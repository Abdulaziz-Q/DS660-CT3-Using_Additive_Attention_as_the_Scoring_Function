### CT3: Using Additive Attention as the Scoring Function

In this activity, we will explain when we can utilize additive attention as the scoring function. 
Create a Python class application that demonstrates additive attention. Show the AdditiveAttention class in action with a toy example in which the shapes 
(batch size, number of steps or sequence length in tokens, feature size) of queries, keys, and values are (2, 1, 20), (2, 10, 2), and (2, 10, 4), respectively.
Lastly, a heatmaps can be used to display attention weights.
